# Single-Deck Blackjack

## Overview
For project one, I created a single-deck blackjack game. 

When players come to the site, they are greeted with a deal button which, when clicked, deals four cards at random. Two cards are the player's cards and are shown face up. Two cards are the dealer's cards, but only one is shown face up.

### Game Play

The player may either hit or stay. Hitting deals another random card. Staying keeps the number of points they have. Point totals are displayed below the respective hands.

Once the player finishes, the dealer plays. The dealer automatically takes cards until it reaches 17 or higher. 

### Scoring
If either the player, or the dealer reaches 21 with their initial 2 cards, it is known as a blackjack, and play stops immediately. 

A hand totalling 22 points or higher is known as a bust, and is an immediate loss.
